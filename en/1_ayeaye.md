## The Aye-aye

Sometime in about the mid 1980s, the phone rang. {{ laughter('.') }}

And the voice said, "We want you to go to [[Madagascar]]. We want you to look
for a very rare form of lemur, called the [[Aye-aye]]. The plane leaves in two
weeks, we would like you to be on it." Now I---assuming they've got the wrong
number---said "yes!" before they could discover their mistake. {{ laughter('.') }}
But in fact it turned out that they decided, "Well, here is somebody who
doesn't know anything about lemurs, anything about the Aye-aye, anything about
Madagascar, let's send him." {{ laughter('.') }}
So I started to try and find out something about it, and it turns out
it's very interesting.

Lemurs used to be the dominant primate in all the world. And they were very,
very gentle, pleasant creatures. They were a little bit like sort of cat
size, and they used to hang around in the trees having a nice time.
And then, [[Gondwanaland]] split up. It always sounds like some sort of 70's rock
group going their own way for reasons of musical differences. But as you
probably remember Gondwanaland was that vast continental landmass that
consisted of what then became South America, Africa, India, Southeast Asia,
Australasia---uh, no---Australia, *Australia* and *not*---and this will turn out to
be significant later---not New Zealand which turns out to be just a lot of gunk
that came out from under the ocean. {{ laughter('.') }}

And as I say, lemurs were the dominant primate around the world, and when all
these landmasses split up, and Madagascar was one of them, Madagascar kind of
sailed off into the middle of what then suddenly became the Indian Ocean.
And took with it a representative sample of the livestock of the period, which
included a lot of lemurs. And they basically sort of sat there for millions
and millions of years in glorious isolation. While, in the rest of the world,
a new creature emerged. A new creature arrived that was much more intelligent
than the lemurs---according to it---, {{ laughter() }} much more competitive, much
more aggressive, and incredibly interested in all of things you could do with
twigs. {{ laughter('.') }}

Twigs were absolutely wonderful. There is so much you can do with twigs---you
can dig in the ground for things with twigs, you can burrow under the bark of
trees for grubs, you can hit each other with twigs. If there had been copies
of *TwigUser Magazine* around on those days, these creatures would have been
lining up for it.
And these creatures---which, as you have probably guessed, are called the
monkeys---, because they were more competitive and more aggressive, and they lived
in the same habitat as the lemurs, they successfully supplanted the lemurs
everywhere in the world other than Madagascar. Because Madagascar was right
out in the middle of the Indian Ocean and they couldn't get there.

They couldn't get there until about 1500 years ago, when due to startling
advances in twig technology {{ laughter() }} they were able to get there in boats,
and eventually planes. And suddenly the lemurs, that have had this place for
themselves for millions and millions and millions of years, were suddenly facing
their old enemy: the monkey.
So, this is Madagascar, and it turns out that the rarest of the lemurs---and when
I say the rarest of the lemurs, at this particular point in the mid 80's they were
thought to be the rarest of the lemurs; we've now discovered and even rarer
lemur called the [[Golden Bamboo Lemur]], which went straight to the number one
of endangered lemurs---but the Aye-aye is a very very peculiar animal. It looks
like the agglomeration of all sorts of other different animals. So, for
instance, it has a sort of foxy ears, and it has a little sort of bitty rabbit's
teeth, and it has a kind of ostrich feathered tail, and it has very weird
eyes, actually it has [[Marty Feldman]]'s eyes. {{ laughter('.') }} The kind of sort
of looking slightly beyond you into a sort of other dimension just over your
left shoulder. But it also has one very very very peculiar characteristic,
which is its middle finger on both hands is skeletally thin and very very
long. {{ laughter('.') }}

And it turns out there is only one other animal in the entire world that has
this feature. And this is called---I love zoologists; they have such vivid
imaginations---it's called the [[Long-Fingered Possum]]. {{ laughter('.') }} And this
is a creature that lives in [[New Guinea]], and in fact it is its fourth
finger that is skeletally thin and elongated. And this is the thing that tells
us that there is no relationship between these animals, it's pure convergent
evolution, because the common factor between Madagascar and the Aye-aye, and
New Guinea and the Long-Fingered Possum is that in both habitats there are no
woodpeckers. {{ laughter('.') }}
And you see, the thing is---life is very very opportunistic, and it will
take advantage of any food source it finds around the place. And if there are
no woodpeckers looking under the bark of trees for grubs, then, in this case,
it will be the mammals that grow the skeletally thin long finger to burrow
under the bark of the tree, and get to this source of food which is the grubs
under the bark.

So, the Aye-aye is this very very very strange creature. And at this time it
was thought there were only about fifteen of them left. And they lived actually
not on Madagascar itself, but on a tiny little rainforest island just off the
coast of Madagascar, called [[Nosy Mangabe]], and it's just off the northwest tip
of Madagascar. And now to get there, what you have to do, is you have to fly
in a 747 to Madagascar. And then in a terrible old *jalopy* of an airplane from
Madagascar up to the northwest port. And from there you have to go in a kind
of decreasingly excellent series of carts and trucks and so on, {{ laughter() }} to
a little port where there was going to be a boat that was going to take us to
Nosy Mangabe. So we arrived there, and arrived at the port, and we were
looking around for the boat that was going to take us to Nosy Mangabe, and we
couldn't see it. And we kept in turn asking people---you know---"where is this
boat?", and they would say "it's there! it's there!", and we couldn't see what
they were pointing at because there was this terrible rotting old hulk in the
way. {{ laughter('.') }}

Well as you guessed, this is the terrible rotting old hulk in which we have to
go to Nosy Mangabe. And it didn't fulfill what to my mind was the
sort of basic criteria of a boat, in that it was basically full of ocean.
{{ laughter('.') }} And it seemed to me that the whole point of a boat was to keep the
ocean on the outside. {{ laughter('.') }}
Anyway, so we crossed to Nosy Mangabe. And it's this tiny little, very very
beautiful little rainforest island. And we hit a major problem which of course
is that this animal not only lives in trees---nobody has seen it for years
and years and years---lives in trees but it's also a nocturnal animal. And the
quality of batteries in Madagascar is very very poor. So, we spent night after
night after night, traipsing through the rainforest, in what can only be
described as: the rain. {{ laughter('.') }}

Getting rather ratty, and basically we've just spent night after night sort
of huddled under tarpaulins, looking at us, saying "stop raining." And
every now and then we would sort of, "gah, I've been trying to find this
damn animal." Actually, this is wonderful, we found this hut that used to be this sort of game warden's---not game warden---a ranger's hut. And it's a tiny little hut. And it was actually full of wild life. {{ laughter('.') }} What happened, you see,
is you would open the door, and you hear all this noise
{{ describe('makes chomping noises') }} and you turn on the light and it would all stop.
{{ laughter('.') }} And you would see these little giant spiders
around the wall, each with  a sort of half-eaten *bug* in their mouth!
{{ laughter('.') }} And say, "yes?" {{ laughter('.') }} And you turn the light out
and {{ describe('makes chomping noises') }}.

So this is our shelter, you know, we were having a great time. But one
night, one night, we were all sort of---as I said---huddled under our tarpaulins,
and I sort of got out, and wandered around, and suddenly, suddenly, I looked
up and at a branch at about that high above my head
{{ describe('looks up and jumps to indicate height') }}, this creature came
out. This creature came out along the branch, looked down on me, and I looked
at it, and as it looked to me---it obviously didn't at all like to look at
what it saw---it turned around and went away again. {{ laughter('.') }}
Whole encounter about ten seconds. And that's what we've come for.

I had actually seen, we all saw---just managed to get a quick
photograph of it when it appeared---but I suddenly realised we've seen an
Aye-aye. Now, I was absolutely transfixed by that moment, for reasons that I
couldn't entirely explain to myself immediately. Because a month earlier I've
never even heard of this animal and now here I was, staring at it, thinking
that something extraordinary happening here. So I began to sort of think about
it a little bit, and the thought I put together was this. In traveling
here, in traveling on a 747 to [[Tananarive]], which is the capital of
Madagascar, and this terrible old jalopy of an airplane that took us out to the
northwest corner, and then in the decreasingly excellent series of carts and
trucks, and then in the rotting old hulk that took us to the rainforest where
we basically walked through the rainforest night after night, it was as if we
were taking a kind of time journey---a time travel journey---back through the
history of twig technology. {{ laughter('.') }}

And what this encounter had been, what this encounter had been was: I was a
monkey looking at a lemur. And you suddenly think, there is a huge amount of
history to this moment that we don't think---we don't realise---we carry
around with us. Our roots in this planet go back an awfully awfully awfully
long way, and we don't tend to think about that very much. And it takes a
confrontation like this to suddenly realise how sort of broad and deep your
family goes. So I thought, well this is terribly interesting. And I talked to
the guy who had been kind of my guide out there, who was a zoologist who had
been sent along to make sure I didn't sort of fall out of the trees and so on.
And his name was [[Mark Carwardine]], and I said to him, "I would love it if
we could ..., do you fancy the idea of sort of going around the world and
looking for other rare and endangered species of animals, maybe doing a book
about this?" He said, "well, that's what I do for a living!" {{ laughter('.') }}
"So yeah, OK." {{ laughter('.') }}
