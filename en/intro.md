### Introduction ###

Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

It's a very interesting, and unusual, and weird experience for me to be talking
in my home town. Which is ... ((Laughter.))

Now, amongst the books that [Constance](http://www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu/constance-penley) mentioned when she's introducing me,
*The Hitchhiker's Guide, Dirk Gently* and so on, it was not my favourite book. And
my favourite book (([[Last Chance to See]])) is what I'm here to talk about tonight. Virtually every author I know, their own favourite book is the one that sold the least. It's somehow the runt of the litter, it's the one you've always just loved the most.
And I want to tell you about how this came about.
