## Questions and answers

And now if anybody has any questions, I'm very happy to take questions, and
there are microphones down here at the front so I suggest you use them.

Yeah, hi.

**Questioner 1:** *Thank you. Wonderful talk. You say we should take care to not
destroy the planet. There is one suggestion that has been made is that, the
reason why we destroy the planet is that we don't pay the true cost of things
when we consume them. The price of gasoline has been falling in real dollars
and the vehicles get bigger and bigger, we have the Selfish Useless
Vehicles---I think they're called---the SUV's.* {{ laughter('.') }} {{ applause('.') }}

You know, I have to say as a brit, you know we sit and think, "the americans
are complaining again because their gas prices have reached now nearly a
quarter of what we pay." {{ laughter('.') }}

**Questioner 1:** *So, I just wonder whether you think that a good solution is that
if we would pay the true cost of things, if we would pay the ten dollars a
gallon or whatever it really costs in terms of the impact on the environment,
that that might make a difference?*

Umm. It may be ..., I ..., it ... {{ laughter('.') }}

There is a problem I'm very very conscious of here. Which is that, even though
I'm talking from a conservationist point of view, very very strongly, you'd
look back over the history of what we and the conservation movement have said
in the last ten years, and the previous ten years, and previous ten years of
that. And most of what we've said we have to do about it, or the way to have
gone about it, have actually turned out to be wrong. So, it's very hard for me
to pretend I can stand up and say we have to do this, and we have to do that.
Because they may not be the right solution. I'm terribly aware of this as far
as, I mean just going back again, I mean thinking about sort of protection of
animals in Africa, for instance. That time after time, we've gone about it the
wrong way. And, yeah, the conservation efforts of once every ten years will be
as much as anything else, undoing the problems caused by the last ten years.
So it is a question of constant sort of self-education, trying to assimilate
the information, trying to see what the consequences of what we've done so far
has been, what we can learn from that. Now it may well be that if we say we're
going to multiply the cost of gas by ten times or whatever, that may have
effects that we would put into ... they would be the lure of unintended
consequences, which comes into play. I think the best thing we can do is
continually inform ourselves, be as aware as possible of what is actually
happening, how if that kind of feedback loop saying now we're going to make
the true cost of the damage we're causing be part of what you have to pay,
then that may be very well be a very good answer; but I'm also worried that it
may *not* be the answer. Which is a complicated way of saying "I don't know."

**Questioner 2:** *Two questions. First. D'you know where your towel is?*
{{ laughter('.') }}

No. {{ laughter('.') }}

**Questioner 2:** *{{ describe('Laughs.') }} OK*.

That was always my problem. It's very funny the thing about the towel because,
... I'll tell you where it came from. I was on a holiday with a bunch of
people, and we were on a Villa in Corfu. And every day we would set out to
the beach, and just as we were setting out for the beach there would be a
problem, and the problem would be that Douglas could not find his towel!
{{ laughter('.') }} Where was my towel? Was it under the bed? Was it on the end of
bed? Was it _in_ the bed? Was it the bathroom? Was it hanging on the line
outside? Was it in the washing...? Was it...? I had no idea, day after day,
where the f... my towel was. {{ laughter('.') }} And after I while I just began to
think this must be symptomatic of somebody who is so sort of deeply chaotic.
But I then... I don't even know whether I even came up with it first, or
somebody on the holiday came with the idea that somebody who was rather
more together than I, would be someone who would really know where their towel
was. {{ laughter('.') }}

And so then, when I was writing the Hitchhiker, I sort of put... You very
often put things in because you know what they mean. And it's really kind of a
flag to yourself that in the next draft through you would put something in
that means to everybody else what this thing means to you. {{ laughter('.') }} You
know. And then it kind of stays there, and it turns out that it does mean
something to everybody else as well.

Does that answer your question?

**Questioner 2:** *OK. And also, do we behave like people descended from
stick-using monkeys or people descended from telephone cleaners.*

I think we have both lots there in our genes, I'm afraid. {{ laughter('.') }}

**Questioner 3:** *I'm absolutely going to kill myself if I get out of here without
asking this. This question occurred to me when my friend bodily forced me to
pick up the first book in The Hitchhiker's Guide and I read the very first
sentences on the very first paragraph, "What on God's green Earth does this man
has against digital watches!?"* {{ laughter('.') }}

Well I have to admit they've improved since {{ laughter('.') }} I actually wrote that
bit. But if you think about it, I mean the first digital watches which were...
You look at a regular watch with hands and you got a pie chart. Remember the
time when were used to get very excited about pie charts being the thing that
computer did for us? {{ describe('waves in exaggeration') }} "Uhhh! Pie charts!"
{{ laughter('.') }} But at the same time when we were getting terribly excited about
pie charts and what they could do for our understanding of the world, we were
saying, "We don't want pie charts on our wrists. That's old fashioned
technology. No what we want is not something you just glance at and see what
the time is. We want something that you've got to go into a dark corner and put
down your suitcase and press a button in order to read, 'Oh it's 11:43,
now what is ...? uhm ...? How long is that before twelve o'clock?'" And this
was progress. {{ laughter('.') }}

But you see, I mean the great thing about human beings, I mean---while we make
fun of it---is not only that we invent stuff that's new, and better, and does
things better. But even stuff that works perfectly well we can't leave well
enough alone, and it's really the most sort of charming and delightful aspect
of human beings, that we keep on inventing things that we've already got right
once. {{ laughter('.') }} I mean like bathroom faucets, I mean it's very very simple,
you turn it on the water comes out, you turn it off the water stops. And we
kind of got the hang of that. That works. But it's amazing you go into, you
know, a hotel lobby or an airport, and you approach the basin with a certain
amount of sort of anxiety, you know. {{ laughter('.') }} "What do I do? Do I turn
something? Do I push something? Do I *pull* something? Do I knee it!?
{{ laughter('.') }} Do I just have to sort of *be* in near it?" {{ laughter('.') }}

And once the water started to flow because it has picked up some sort of
brainwave energy from me or whatever. {{ laughter('.') }} "So, now how do I stop it?
Is it my job to stop it? {{ laughter('.') }} Would it stop itself?" I mean, I think
we've got the faucet down OK. But, I just think it's wonderful we just sort of keep
on inventing it even though it works, because it's the way of getting
ourselves off local maximums isn't it?

I think that's all I have to say there. Thanks. {{ laughter('.') }} {{ applause('.') }}
