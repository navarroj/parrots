### The Komodo Dragon Lizard ###

And so we did. Now, there was a pause at that moment because I had a couple of
novels I've just been contracted to write. So I wrote
[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]] and
[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]], and *then* it was time to go.
((Laughter.))

And the first place we went, we went to look for a particular
animal which is the [[Komodo Dragon Lizard|Komodo Dragon]]. Now you know
what lizards are like, don't you? I mean they're sort of
((makes mime with hands to suggest a size of about 12 inches)).
The Komodo Dragon Lizard is a little bit bigger than that. The biggest
one we saw actually it
was about 13 feet long, and its head came out to about here
((makes mime with hands to suggest a height to about his hip)), fucking huge
I think is the technical term. ((Laughter.))
It's thought to be the origin of the chinese dragon myth---because they
are well huge, giant giant lizards, they're scaly, they're man eaters,
literally they're man eaters, and they don't actually breathe fire, but they
*do* have the worst breath of any creature known to man.

And they live on this island called [[Komodo|Komodo (island)]].
Now, it's not enough---it turns out---that this island has fifteen hundred,
fifteen hundred man-eating dragons on it. ((Laughter.))
It turns our that actually that the most endangered animal on the
island is anything *other* than the dragons. ((Laughter.))
In fact---as I said---they're man eaters. They don't actually eat you sort
of straight out, they don't sort of lunge at you and just gobble you up.
They sort of sneak around and they come and give you a bit of a bite.
Because their saliva is so virulent that
your wound would not heal and after a while you will die. And so one of the
dragons will get to eat you---it doesn't matter if it's the same one that bit
you---they just have a strategy of having as many dead and dying creatures
lying around the island ((laughter)) as they can manage
and that kind of keeps them going.

But it turns out it's not enough that the island has fifteen hundred
man-eating dragons on it. Just to make it a little bit more interesting, it
also has more poisonous snakes on it---per square meter of land---than any
equivalent area of land anywhere on earth. So, we approach Komodo---I have to
say---slightly nervously, and in a slightly roundabout way. In fact we
approached in such a roundabout way that went by [[Melbourne]] in Australia.
((Laughter.)) And the reason we went by Melbourne was somebody who we wanted
to go and see there, a man called [[Dr. Struan Sutherland|Struan Sutherland]].
Actually I want to read you a little bit about him, he was a great expert in
snake venom.

I should apologise before I read this, actually, for the fact that
my australian accent isn't very good. But then, what the hell, you're
all americans you ain't know the difference anyway. ((Laughter.))

> He handed round the snake venom detection kits and these home baked fairy

> ``None of 'em,'' he said. ``Another area of expertise I've developed is that

> Well in addition to the boots wear thick baggy trousers. And preferably have
> half a dozen people trampling along in front of you making as much noise as
> possible. ((Laughter.)) The snakes pick up the vibrations and get out of your
> way. Unless it's a [[Death Adder|Acanthophis]], otherwise known as the
> *Deaf* Adder, ((laughter)) which just lies there. People can walk right past

> We asked, tentatively, if we could perhaps take a snake bite detector kit with

>
> ``Course you can, course you can. Take as many as you like. Won't do you a
> blind bit of good because they're only for Australian snakes.'' ((Laughter.))
>
> ``So what do we do if we get bitten by something deadly, then?'' I asked.
>
> He blinked at me as if I were stupid. ((Laughter.))
>
> ``Well what do you think you do?'' he said. ``You die of course. That's what
> deadly means.'' ((Laughter.))
>
> ``But what about cutting open the wound and sucking out the poison?''
> I asked.
>
> ``Rather you than me,'' he said. ((Laughter.)) ``I wouldn't want a mouthful
> of poison. Shouldn't do you any harm, though, snake toxins are of high
> molecular weight so they wont penetrate the blood vessels in the mouth the

> acids in your stomach. But it's not necessarily going to do much good either.
> I mean, you're not likely to be able to get much of the poison out, but
> you're probably going to make the wound a lot worse trying. And in a place
> like Komodo it means you'd quickly have a seriously infected wound to contend
> with well as a leg full of poison. Septicaemia, gangrene, you name it,
> it'll kill you.''
>
> ``What about a tourniquet?'' I asked.
>
> ``Well, fine if you don't mind having your leg cut off afterwards. You'd have
> to because if you cut off the blood supply to it completely it will just die.
> And if you can find anyone in that part of Indonesia who you'd trust to take
> your leg off then you're a braver man than me. ((Laughter.)) No, I'll tell
> you, the only thing you can do is apply a pressure bandage direct to the
> wound and wrap the whole leg up tightly, but not too tightly. Slow the blood
> flow but don't cut it off or you'll lose the leg. Hold your leg, or whatever
> bit you've been bitten in, lower than your heart and your head. Keep very,
> very still, breathe slowly and get to a doctor immediately. ((Laughter.))
> If you're on Komodo that means a couple of days, by which time you'll be well
> dead. ((Laughter.))
>
> ``Now, the only answer, and I mean this quite seriously, is don't get bitten.
> There's no reason why you should. Any of the snakes there will get out of
> your way well before you even see them. You don't really need to worry about
> the snakes if you're careful. No, the things you really need to worry about
> are the marine creatures.''
>
> ``What?'' ((Laughter.))
>
> ``[[Scorpion fish]], [[stonefish]], [[sea snakes]]. Much more poisonous than
> anything on land. Get stung by a stonefish and the pain alone will kill you.
> People drown themselves just to stop the pain.'' ((Laughter.))
>
> ``Where are all these things?''
>
> ``Oh, just in the sea. Tons of them. I wouldn't go near it if I were you.
> Full of poisonous animals. Hate them.'' ((Laughter.))
>
> ``Is there anything you do like?''
>
> ``Yes. Hydroponics.'' ((Laughter.))
>
> ``No'', I said, ``I mean are there any poisonous creatures you're

>
> He looked out of the window for a moment.
>
> ``There was,'' he said, ``but she left me.'' ((Laughter.)) ((Applause.))
