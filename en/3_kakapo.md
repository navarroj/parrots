### The Kakapo ###

Anyway, in fact my favourite of all the animals we went to see, my favourite,
was an animal called the [[Kakapo]]. And the Kakapo is a kind of parrot. It
lives in New Zealand. It's a flightless parrot, it has forgotten how to fly.
Sadly, it has also forgotten that it has forgotten how to fly. ((Laughter.))
So a seriously worried Kakapo has been known to run up a tree and jump out of
it. ((Laughter.)) Opinion divides as to what next happens: ((laughter)) some
people said it has developed a kind of rudimentary parachuting ability,
((laughter)) other people says it flies a bit like a brick. ((Laughter.))

But the thing is---I might talk about a seriously worried Kakapo---the fact is
you're not likely to find a seriously worried Kakapo because Kakapos have not
learned to worry. ((Laughter.)) It seems an extraordinary thing to say because
worrying is something we're all so terribly good at, and which comes so
absolutely naturally to us, we think it must be as natural as breathing. But
it turns out that worrying is simply an acquired habit like anything else. It's
something you're genetically disposed to do or not to do. And the thing is that
the Kakapo grew up in New Zealand which was, until man arrived, a country which
had no predators. And it's predators that, over a series of generations, will
teach you to worry. ((Laughter.)) And if you don't have predators then the need
to worry will never occur to you.

Now I said earlier, that New Zealand turns out to be just a load of gunk that
came out from under the ocean. And this is why, when it emerged, it didn't
have any life on it at all---maybe a few dead fish. ((Laughter.)) So the only
animals that inhabited New Zealand were the animals that could fly there,
i.e. birds. There were are also a couple of species of bats which are mammals,
but you get the point. So it was only birds that lived on New Zealand. And, in
an absence of predators, there was nothing for them to worry about. Now it's
very very peculiar for us to try and understand this because we have never ever
encountered an environment with no predators in it. Why not? Because we are
predators and because, therefore, if we are in that environment it is a
predated environment.
For the europeans who originally arrived in New Zealand, ... sorry, that was
an extraordinary thing to say. Of course the [[M캐ori]]s before them and before
then the [[Moriori]]s, the M캐oris *ate* the Morioris ((laughter)) and then
the europeans came along. But before all of that happened---as I said---the
island had no predators, and the birds basically lived a worry-free life.

Now you can actually see another example of this if you go to [[Gal치pagos]],
there is a type of animal, there is a bird on the Gal치pagos Islands called the
[[Blue-footed Booby]]. And the Blue-footed Booby is so called---I believe---for
two reasons: one of which has to be with the colour of his feet, ((laughter))
and the other has to do with this piece of behaviour I'm about to describe.
Because, apparently you can walk up to a Blue-footed Booby---it will be sitting
there on the beach or on a branch---and you can walk up and you can sort of
pick him up. ((Laughter.)) And what the Booby will be thinking is that once you
finish with him you'll put him back. ((Laughter.))
And if you haven't lived through generation after generation of people trying
to eat you, it's very easy to come to that conclusion. ((Laughter.))

So the Kakapo, as I say, had grown up in an environment without predators. And
because they were all birds, and because nature has a way---as I say---very
opportunistic and life will flow into any niche where it's possible to make a
living, so---if I can be very naughty and anthropomorphise for a moment---it's
as if some of the birds figured out, ``Well, this flying stuff is very very
expensive. It takes a lot of energy, you have to eat a bit, fly a bit, eat a
bit, fly a bit, because every time you eat something---you know---you weight
down and it's heavier to fly, so eat a bit, fly a bit---I mean---there are
other ways of life available.'' And so it's as if some of the birds said, ``Well,
actually what we could do is we could settle in for a rather larger meal, and
go for a waddle afterwards!'' ((Laughter.))

And so gradually over many many generations a lot of the birds lost the
ability to fly, they took up life on the ground. The [[Kiwi]], the most famous
bird---I guess---of New Zealand, and the [[Weka]], and the old night
parrot---as it was called---the Kakapo. Which is this sort of big, fat, soft,
fluffy, lugubrious bird. ((Laughter.)) And because it has never learned to
worry, when man arrived and brought with him his deadly menagerie of dogs, and
cats, and stoats, and the most destructive of all animals--other than
man---which is [[Rattus rattus]], the ship's rat. Suddenly, suddenly these
birds were waddling for their lives. ((Laughter.)) Except in fact they didn't
know how to do that because they were confronted with an animal which was a
predator, they didn't know what to do, they didn't know what the social form
was, they just waited for the other animal to make the next move, and of
course---as usually---a fairly swift and deadly one. ((Laughter.))

So, suddenly from there being a population of---we don't know exactly of how
many---probably not as many as a million, but hundreds of thousands of these
birds, their population plunged at an incredible rate down into the low
forties. Which is roughly where it is at the moment. And, so there are groups
of people who dedicated their entire lives to try to save these animals, trying
to conserve them. And one of the problems they've come across is that it's all
very well just to protect them---from predators---which is very very very hard
to do. But the next problem they come across is the mating habits of the
Kakapo. Because it turns out that the mating habits of the Kakapo are
incredibly long drawn-out, fantastically complicated, and almost entirely
ineffective. ((Laughter.))

Some people would tell you that the mating call of the male Kakapo *actively*
repels the female Kakapo, ((laughter)) which is the sort of behaviour you would otherwise only find really in discotheques. The people who've heard the mating
call of the male Kakapo will tell you, you can hardly even hear it, it's like a
sort of ... I'll tell you what they do.
This animal every---for about a hundred nights of the year---it goes through
its mating ritual.

And what it does is it finds some great rocky outcrop looking out over the
great rolling valleys of New Zealand, because acoustics are very important for
what it's about to happen. ((Laughter.))
It carves out this kind of bowl that it sits in. And it sits there, and it puffs
out this great sort of air-sacks around his chest. And it sits there---and these
are reverberation chambers, this is a kind of reverberation chamber---and it
sits there and for night after night after night for a hundred nights of the
year, for eight hours of the night, it performs the opening bars of
[[The Dark Side of the Moon]].[^dsotm] ((Laughter.))
Now, I see some grey hairs here so you'll know the album I'm referring to.
((Laughter.))
Which as you remember starts with this great sort of *boom*, *boom*, *boom*,
it's a heartbeat sound. And this is the noise, that the Kakapo
makes. But it's so, it's so deep, that you more kind of feel it like a wobble
in the pit of your stomach. You can only just sort of tune your hearing in to
it. Now I never managed to get to hear it, but those who do say they feel it's
a very *eerie* sound because you don't really hear it, you more kind of feel it.

[^dsotm]: For those curious, there is a YouTube video of
[the song and the particular sound][dsotm_video] that Douglas is referring to.

[dsotm_video]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmjS37zDbPY

And, it's bass sound. It's very very deep bass sound, just below our level of
our hearing. Now it turns out that bass sound has two important
characteristics to it. One of which is that these great long waves, these
great long sound waves travel great distances, and they fill these great
valleys of the south island of New Zealand. And that's good. That's good. But
there is another characteristic of bass sounds, which you may be familiar
with, if you've got this kind of---you know---the kind of stereo speakers you can
get. Where you have two tiny little ones that give you your treble sound, and
you have to put them very carefully in the room, because they're going to
define the stereo image. And then you have what's known as a subwoofer which
is the bass box, and that's going to produce just the bass sound and you can
put that anywhere in the room you like. You can put it behind the sofa if you
like, because the other characteristic of bass sound---and remember we're
talking about the mating call of the male Kakapo---is that you can't tell where
it's coming from! ((Laughter.))

So just imagine if you will, this male Kakapo sitting up here, making all this
booming noise which, if there's a female out there---which there probably
isn't---and if she likes the sound of this booming---which she probably
doesn't---then she can't find the person who's making it! ((Laughter.))
But supposing she does, supposing she's out there---but she probably
isn't---she likes the sound of this booming---she probably doesn't---supposing
that she can find him---which she probably can't---she will then only consent
to mate if the [[Podocarpus]] tree is in fruit! ((Laughter.))

Now we've all had relationships like that ... ((Laughter.)) ((Applause.))

But supposing they get through all those obstacles, supposing she manages to
find him, she will then lay one egg every two or three years which will
promptly get eaten by a stoat or rat. ((Laughter.)) And you think, well so
far---before trying to sort of save them and conserve them---how on earth has
it managed to survive for this long!

And the answer is terribly interesting, which is this: it seems like
absurd behaviour to us, but it's only because its environment has changed in
one particular and dramatic way that is completely invisible to us. And its
behaviour is perfectly attuned to the environment it developed in, and
completely out of tune with the environment it now finds itself in. Because in
an environment when nothing is trying to predate you, you don't want to
reproduce too fast. And it turns out you can actually sort of graph this in a
computer. That if you take a given reproduction rate, and you take the ability
of any given environment to sustain any particular level of population. And
you start say with a fairly low reproduction rate, and you just plot it over
several generations and you find that the population goes up and up and up and
then sort of steadies out and achieves a nice plateau. Tweak the reproduction
rate up a bit, and it goes up a little bit higher, and then maybe settles
down, and levels out. Tweak the reproduction rate a little bit higher yet, and
it goes up, and it goes too high, and it drops down, it goes too low, goes up,
too high, and settles into an oscillating sine wave. Tweak it a bit more, and
it starts to oscillate between four different values. Tweak it more and more
and more and you suddenly hit this terribly fashionable condition called
chaos. ((Laughter.))
Where the population of the animal just swings wildly from one year to
another, and will just hit zero at one point just out of the sheer mathematics
of the situation. And once you've hit zero, there is kind of no coming back.
((Laughter.))

And so, because because nature tends to be very parsimonious and is not going
to expend energy and resources on something for which there is no return. So
the reproduction rate of an animal in an environment with no predators will
tune itself to an appropriate level of reproduction. Now, if there is nothing
trying to eat you---particularly---then that reproduction rate will be very
low. And that is the rate at which the Kakapo *used* to reproduce, and continues
to reproduce despite the fact that it's being predated, because it doesn't
know any better. Because nothing has managed to teach it anything different
along the way, because the change that occurred happened so suddenly, that
there is no kind of slope, there is no slope of gradual evolutionary pressure,
which is the thing that tends to bring about change. If you have a sudden
dramatic change then there is no direction to go and you just have disaster.

So, again if I can anthropomorphise for a moment, what seems to have happened
is that the animal suddenly reaching a crisis in his population thinks, ``Whoa,
whoa! I better just do, do, what I do fantastically well, do what is my main
thing, which is I reproduce really really slowly!'' ((Laughter.)) And its
population goes down. ``Well, I'd better really do what I do, and reproduce
really really really really slowly!'' And it seems absurd to us because we can
see a larger picture than they can. But if that is the type of behaviour that
you've evolved successfully to produce, then to do anything else would be
against kakapo-nature, would be an *inkakapo* thing to do. And it has nothing
to teach it any other than to just do what it's always done, to follow its
successful strategy, and because times have changed around it, it's no longer
a successful strategy, and the animal is in terrible trouble.
