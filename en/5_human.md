## The Human

And, it's very peculiar to me that we are living at the moment in an
extraordinary age, an extraordinary renaissance, because we've
got to the point when we suddenly understand the value of information, as we
never have before. We call the age we live in that of information. And we've
discovered that information is the most valuable resource we have. And as
you'd know we've just spent billions of dollars---quite rightly---in trying to
understand the human genome, and that's just one species, that's just us. And
we've come to understand and realize how incredibly valuable this information is.

And we've never understood kind of how it all worked together before, because
before we had ... let me put it this way. In the past we've done science by
taking things apart to see how they work. And it's led to extraordinary
discoveries, extraordinary degrees of understanding, but the problem with
taking things apart to see how they work is even though it gets you down to
the sort of fundamental particles, the fundamental principles, the fundamental
forces at work, we still don't *really* understand how they work until we see
them in motion.

One of the things that came about as a result of our
understanding of these fundamental principles, is that we came to invent this
thing called the computer. And the great thing about the computer is that,
unlike every previous analytical tool---and there are a bit ... it's funny how
many of these have to do with glass, when we first came across glass, which is
a form of sand, and we invented lenses, and we looked up into the sky, and
by studying the sky we began to discover fundamental things about gravity,
and we also discovered that the universe seems to consist---terrifyingly
enough---almost entirely of nothing.
The next thing we did with glass was we put them in microscopes, and we looked
down into this very very very solid world around us, and we see the
fundamental particles there, the atoms---made up of protons and neutrons with
electrons spinning around them---and we also discover that they seem to consist
frighteningly almost entirely of nothing. And that even when you *do* find
something it turns out that it isn't actually there, it isn't actually a thing
there, merely the possibility that there may be something there. {{ laughter('.') }}
It kind of doesn't feel as real as this {{ describe('hits podium with his hand') }}.
{{ laughter('.') }}

So the next thing we do with sand was silicon, as we create the
computer. And this finally enables us to start putting things together to see
how they work. And it allows us to see actual processes at work, and we begin to
see how very very simple things lead inexorably---by iteration after
iteration---to enormously complex processes emerging and blossoming. And to my
mind one of the most extraordinary things of our age---I mean those of us who
were around will remember, you know, seeing man walking on the moon for the
first time---but I think the most dramatic and extraordinary thing that we have
seen in our time is being able to see, on computer screens, the process by which
enormously simple primitive things, processes, instructions, repeated many
many times over, very very fast, and iterated over generations of
instructions, produce enormously complex results. So that we can suddenly
start to create, just out of fundamentally simple primitive instructions, we
can create the way in which wind behaves in a wind tunnel, a turbulence of
wind, we can see how light might dance in an imaginary dinosaur's eye. And we
do it all out of fundamentally simple instructions. And as a result of that we
have finally come to an understanding of the way in which life has actually
emerged. Now, there are an awful lot of things we don't know about life. But
any life scientist will tell you that, although there is an awful lot we don't
know, there is no longer a deep mystery. There is no longer a deep mystery
because we have actually seen with our own eyes the way in which simplicity
gives rise to complexity.

When I say there is no mystery it is rather as if you imagine taking
a detective from the 19th century, teaming him up with a detective from the
late 20th century, and giving them this problem to work on: that a suspect in
a crime was seen one day to be walking down the street in the middle of
London, and the next day was seen somewhere out in the desert in the middle
of New Mexico. Now the 19th century detective will say, "Well, I haven't the
faintest idea. I mean it must be some species of magic has happened." And he
would have no idea about how to begin to solve what has happened here. For
the 20th century detective, now he may never know whether the guy went on
British Airways or United or American or where he hired his car from, or all
that kind of stuff, he may never find those details, but there wont be any
fundamental mystery about what has happened.

So for us there is no longer a fundamental mystery about life. It is all the
process of extraordinary eruptions of information. And is information that
gives us this fantastically rich complex world in which we live. But at the
same time that we've discovered that, we are destroying it at a rate that has
no precedent in history, unless you go back to the point that we're hit by an
asteroid.

So there is a kind of terrible irony that at the point that we are best able
to understand, and appreciate, and value the richness of life around us, we
are destroying it at a higher rate that it has even been destroyed before. And
we are losing species after species after species, day after day, just
because we're burning the stuff down for firewood. And this is a kind of
terrible indictment of our understanding. But, you see, we make another
mistake, because we think somehow, this is all right in some fundamental kind
of way, because we think that this is all sort of "meant to happen."

Now let me explain how we get into that kind of mindset, because it's exactly
the same kind of mindset that the Kakapo gets trapped in. Because, what has
been a very successful strategy for the Kakapo over generation after
generation for thousands and thousands of years, suddenly is the wrong
strategy, and he has no means of knowing because he is just doing what has
been successful up till then. And we have always been, because we're
toolmakers, because we take from our environment the stuff that we need to
do what we want to do and it's always been very successful for us ...

I'll tell you what's happened. It's as if we've actually kind of put the sort
of "pause" button on our own process of evolution, because we have put a
buffer around us, which consists of---you know---medicine and education and
buildings, and all these kinds of things that protect us from the normal
environmental pressures. And, it's our ability to make tools that enables us
to do this.
Now, generally speaking, what drives speciation, is that a small group of
animals gets separated out from the main body by population pressure, some
geographical upheaval or whatever. So imagine, a small bunch suddenly finds
itself stranded in a slightly colder environment. Then you know, over a small
number of generations that those genes that favour a thicker coat will come to
the fore and you come back a few generations later, and the animal's got a
thicker coat.
Man, because we are able to make tools, we arrive in a new environment where
it's much colder, and we don't have to wait for that process. Because we see
an animal that's already got a thicker coat and we say we'll have it off him.
{{ laughter('.') }}
And so we've kind of taken control of our environment, and that's all very
well, but we need to be able to sort of rise above that process. We have to
rise above that vision and see a higher vision---and understand the effect
we're actually having.

Now imagine---if you will---an early man, and let's just sort of see how this
mindset comes about. He's standing, surveying his world at the end of the day.
And he looks at it and thinks, "This is a very wonderful world that I find
myself in. This is pretty good. I mean, look, here I am, behind me is the
mountains, and the mountains are great because there are caves in the
mountains where I can shelter, either from the weather or from bears that
occasionally come and try to attack me. And I can shelter there, so that's
great. And in front of me there is the forest, and the forest is full of nuts and
berries and trees, and they feed me, and they're delicious and they sort of
keep me going. And here's a stream going through which has got fish running
through it, and the water is delicious, and I drink the water, and everything's
fantastic.

"And there's my cousin Ug. And Ug has caught a mammoth! Yay!! {{ describe('claps')}}. Ug
has caught a mammoth! Mammoths are terrific! There's nothing greater than a
mammoth, because a mammoth, basically you can wrap yourself in the fur from
the mammoth, you can eat the meat of the mammoth, and you can use the bones of
the mammoth, to catch other mammoths! {{ laughter('.') }}

"Now this world is a fantastically good world for me." And, part of how we
come to take command of our world, to take command of our environment, to make
these tools that are actually able to do this, is we ask ourselves questions
about it the whole time. So this man starts to ask himself questions. "This
world," he says, "well, who ... so, so who made it?" Now, of course he
thinks that, because he makes things himself, so he's looking for someone who
will have *made* this world. He says, "So, who would have made this world?
Well, it must be something a little bit like me. Obviously much much bigger,
{{ laughter() }} and necessarily invisible, {{ laughter() }} but he would have made
it. Now, why did he make it?"

Now, we always ask ourselves "why" because we look for intention around us,
because we always do something with intention. You know, we boil an
egg in order to eat it. So, we look at the rocks and we look at the trees, and
we wonder what intention is here, even though it doesn't have intention. So we
think, what did this person who made this world intend it for. And this is the
point where you think, "Well, it fits *me* very well. {{ laughter('.') }} You know,
the caves and the forests, and the stream, and the mammoths.
He must have made it for me! I mean, there's no other conclusion you can
come to."

And it's rather like a puddle waking up one morning---I know they don't normally
do this, but allow me, I'm a science fiction writer. {{ laughter('.') }} A puddle
wakes up one morning and thinks, "This is a very interesting world I find myself
in. It fits me very neatly.
In fact, it fits me so neatly, I mean, really precise, isn't it?
{{ laughter('.') }} It must have been made to have me in it!" And the sun rises, and
he's continuing to narrate the story about this hole being made to have him in
it. And the sun rises, and gradually the puddle is shrinking and shrinking and
shrinking, and by the time the puddle ceases to exist, it's still thinking,
it's still trapped in this idea, that the hole was there for it. And if we
think that the world is here for us, we will continue to destroy it in the way
that we've been destroying it, because we think we can do no harm.

There's an awful lot of speculation one way or another at the moment, about
whether there's life on other planets or not. Carl Sagan, as you know, was
very keen on the idea that there must be. The sheer numbers dictate, because
there are billions and billions and billions {{ laughter() }}---as he famously did
not say, in fact---of worlds out there, so the chance must be that there's other
intelligent life out there. There are other voices at the moment you'll hear
saying, well actually if you look at the set of circumstances here on Earth,
they are so extraordinarily specific that the chances of there being something
like this out there, are actually pretty remote.
Now, in a way it doesn't matter. Because think of this---I mean Carl Sagan, I
think, himself, said this. There are two possibilities: either there is life
out there on other planets, or there is no life out there on other planets.
They are both utterly extraordinary ideas! {{ laughter('.') }} But, there is a strong
possibility that there isn't anything out there remotely like this. And we are
behaving as if this planet, this extraordinary, utterly, utterly extraordinary
little ball of life, is something we can just screw about with any way we
like.

And maybe we can't. Maybe we should be looking after it just a little bit
better. Not for the world's sake---we talk rather grandly about "saving the
world." We don't have to save the world--the world's fine! The world has been
through five periods of mass extinction. Sixty-five million years ago when, as
it seems, a comet hit the Earth at the same time that there were vast volcanic
eruptions in India, which saw off the dinosaurs, and something like 90% of the
life on the planet at the time. Go back another, I think is 150 million
years earlier than that, to the [[Permian-Triassic boundary]], another giant,
giant, giant extinction. The world has been through it many many times before.
And what tends to happen, what happens invariably after each mass extinction,
is that there's a huge amount of space available, for new forms of life
suddenly to emerge and flourish into. Just as the extinction of the dinosaurs
made way for us. Without that extinction, we would not be here.

So, the world is fine. We don't have to save the world---the world is big
enough to look after itself. What we have to be concerned about, is whether or
not the world we live in, will be capable of sustaining us in it. That's what
we need to think about. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. {{ applause('.') }}
