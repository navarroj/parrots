## The Yangtze River Dolphin

There is another animal we went to find, it is in even worse trouble now. And
this is the Baiji, the [[Yangtze River Dolphin]], which is an almost blind river
dolphin. The reason it's almost blind, is that there is *nothing* to see in the
[[Yangtze River]]. {{ laughter('.') }}

Thousands and thousands of years of agriculture along the banks
of the Yangtze River have washed so much mud and silt and so on into it, that the
river has become completely turbid. Which is a word I didn't even know the
meaning of until I saw the Yangtze River, and basically you can't see anything
in it. So these animals, dolphins as I said, gradually they abandoned the use
of sight. Now---as we all know---marine mammals also have this other faculty
available to them, which they can develop, which is that of sound. And so what
the Yangtze River Dolphins did was over thousands of years, as their eye sight
deteriorated, so their sonar abilities became more and more and more
sophisticated, and more powerful and more complex.

And it's very interesting, you can actually watch---if you feel like it---the
development of a Baiji foetus, and you'll see that right at---as you may or may
not know---there is a certain amount of truth in the idea that the development of
the foetus recapitulates stages in the evolutionary development of an animal.
And you see, right at the beginning of the development of the foetus, its eyes
are in the normal dolphin position, which are kind of relatively far down on the
side of the head.
And gradually, as the generations have gone by, its eyes have kind
of migrated up the side of the head, and you see this happening as the foetus
develops. Because gradually, over the generations, its only light is coming
directly from up above and there is no ambient light and then, as that too
dies out, so the eyes gradually atrophied. And, instead, the sonar abilities
take over. And these animals developed incredibly sensitive, and incredibly
precise abilities to navigate themselves around in the water just using sonar.
And all is well and good.

Until the twentieth century when man invents the diesel engine. And suddenly
all hell breaks loose beneath the surface of the Yangtze, because it's suddenly
full of noise. And so, suddenly these animals find themselves trapped by
something that they---that nobody had any means of foreseeing---that the thing
they now rely on has been completely overwhelmed by the noise pollution that we
put in the oceans. So suddenly these animals that used to be so sophisticated
in their ability to find their way around, are sort of bumping into things,
bumping into boats, bumping into ships' propellers, finding themselves
ensnared in fishermen's nets and so on, because we basically screwed up the next
of their faculties. And it's a very curious feeling, I remember sort of
sitting on a boat on the Yangtze River and looking, well trying to look
into---you couldn't look into cause it's turbid and you remember what turbid
means---and realising that all this noise down there means that ...
It's very curious to think that there may have been a dolphin
somewhere near me---I didn't know, I mean by this stage, this was ten years
ago, there were only two hundred left in a structure of water of about two
hundred miles long, so you had no idea if there was one anywhere near
you---but it's curious because you think if you and another person, another
creature, are kind of in the same world, then you must be feeling roughly
similar. But one of the things you begin to realise when you look at different
animals is that because of their evolutionary history, and because of
the forms they have developed into, and the ways they have developed of
perceiving the world, they may be inhabiting the same world but actually a
completely different universe. But actually a completely different universe
because you create your only own universe from what you do with the sensory
data coming in. So, you realise that you're here, and there is a dolphin
there, and you're comfortable, and the dolphin may be actually in a species of
hell. But has no means of communicating that with you because we've kind of
taken charge, and there is no way of kind of communicating with the
management, there's a problem. {{ laughter('.') }}

So, I suddenly became very interested in what it must actually sound like in
the Yangtze River. Now, we've gone to record some BBC Radio programmes while we
are there, so as well as Mark Carwardine the zoologist, we also had a sound
recordist from the BBC. So I said to him, "Could we actually drop a microphone
into the Yangtze so that we can see what it actually sounds like in the
river?" And he said, "Well you should have said that before we left London."
{{ laughter('.') }} And I said, "Why?" And he said, "Well, cause I just could
have checked out a waterproof microphone but, you know, you didn't mention
anything about recording under water." And I said, "No, I didn't. Is there
anything we could do about it?" And he said, "Well there is, there is
actually one technique they teach us at the BBC for recording under water in
an emergency. {{ laughter('.') }} Do either of you have condoms with you?"

And we didn't. Wasn't that kind of trip. {{ laughter('.') }} But we decided we'd
better go and buy some. And so we went into the streets of Shanghai trying
to buy some condoms, and I just want to read you a little passage about this.

So a couple of days later we were standing on the banks of the Yangtze, on a
very desperate drizzly grey day. And we put the microphone in this little
sort of pink thing, {{ laughter() }} and dropped it into the water. And, I don't
usually do impressions but I'm going to do for you an impression of what it
sounds like under the surface of the Yangtze River. And it's something like
this *"pfffffffffff"*. The Yangtze River ladies and gentleman.
{{ laughter('.') }} {{ applause('.') }}

And, I suddenly realized what an appalling thing we've
inflicted on these poor animals, that live in a world of super sensitive sound
and hearing. And this was why these animals were now desperately endangered
because having removed one way of life from them we were now removing a
second. The problem is we're about to remove a third, I said that when I was
there it was ten years ago, there were two hundred of these left, today there
are twenty. And because the Chinese are building these giant dams to dam the
Yangtze at one of the most beautiful and most spectacular sites in all world,
the [[Three Gorges]], and they're damming it there which means that the Yangtze
Dolphin will at that point definitely go extinct.[^yangtze-extinct]

[^yangtze-extinct]: According to Wikipedia, the [[Yangtze River Dolphin]] was indeed declared functionally extinct as of 2006.

And it's terribly sad. The peculiar thing about dams is that we keep on
building them and none of them ever do any good. It's not quite true, because
unfortunately there are---in the history of dam-making---two that did work,
one is the [[Hoover|Hoover Dam]] and the other is the one up in the pacific
northwest, the [[Coulee Dam|Grand_Coulee_Dam]]. And every other one doesn't work.
And for some reason we never manage to be able to quite stop us ... we always think we just
build one more. I think must have some sort of beaver genes deep in our ...
{{ laughter('.') }} But the sad thing as I say is that the Yangtze River dolphin is
definitely and without doubt bound for extinction.
