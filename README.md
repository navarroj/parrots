# Parrots, the Universe and Everything

These are sources of transcripts for “Parrots, the Universe and Everything”, one of the last public lectures of [Douglas Adams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams), recorded by the [University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)](http://www.ucsb.edu/) in 2001 shortly before his dead.

## History

* June 2010. [navarroj](https://github.com/navarroj) started this project, writing down the first raw draft of the transcript in English. Although mostly complete, this first draft was far from perfect---not being a native speaker there were a few places where he couldn't get the precise words from Douglas, and some misspellings invariably slipped through.

  Starting as an experiment in ‘openness’ he made the sources of the transcript publicly editable (i.e. wiki-style), so by-passers could contribute adding the missing pieces and generally improving the transcript. At the time this was just a bunch of messy perl scripts on top of svn, all hosted at navarroj.com/parrots.

* July 2010. This turned out to be a fantastic idea. Already a month after starting the project the first edits, from anonymous contributors over the internet, started coming in.

* May 2011. Nearly a year after the project started the draft was essentially complete, no more missing bits in the text. Still, small fixes, added notes and other improvements kept coming in.

* June 2011. [navarroj](https://github.com/navarroj) publishes a series of blog posts translating the transcript to Spanish: [el aye-aye](http://pedazosdecarbono.blogspot.com/2011/06/loros-el-universo-y-todo-el-aye-aye.html), [Komodo](http://pedazosdecarbono.blogspot.com/2011/06/loros-el-universo-y-todo-komodo.html), [el kakapo](http://pedazosdecarbono.blogspot.com/2011/06/loros-el-universo-y-todo-el-kakapo.html), [el baiji](http://pedazosdecarbono.blogspot.com/2011/06/loros-el-universo-y-todo-el-kakapo.html), y [el humano](http://pedazosdecarbono.blogspot.com/2011/07/loros-el-universo-y-todo-el-humano.html).

* March 2013. [maldoreur](http://amara.org/en/profiles/profile/91116/) starts the first [Greek translation](http://amara.org/en/videos/yoedZnaqoAov/el/37982/) and syncs subtitles at amara.org.

* August 2014. The transcript site is moved to [nokyotsu.com/parrots](http://nokyotsu.com/parrots/). The previous link still works, but it's just a redirect.

* August 2015. [arnauld](http://amara.org/en/profiles/profile/390531/) syncs the transcript with the UCSB video to provide [English subtitles](http://amara.org/en/videos/yoedZnaqoAov/en/230539/) at amara.org.
