## History

* **August 2019.** [nokyotsu][] makes a few tweaks to the sources, and updates
  the rendering mechanism (a customised [mistune][] for markdown parsing and
  [jinja][] templates). The rendered page is now made available at
  [nokyotsu.github.io/parrots](https://nokyotsu.github.io/parrots/).

* **August 2015.** [nokyotsu][] moves the sources of the transcript into this public
  github repository. Further editions to the transcript, or translations into other
  languages, can be added as pull requests.

* **August 2015.** [arnauld][] syncs the transcript to provide [English subtitles][subs_en]
  at amara.org.

* **August 2014.** The transcript site is moved to nokyotsu.com/parrots/.
  The previous link still works, but now it's just a redirect.

* **March 2013.** [maldoreur][] starts the first [Greek translation][subs_el] and syncs
  subtitles with the UCSB video at amara.org.

* **June 2011.** [nokyotsu][] publishes a series of blog posts at
  [*Pedazos de Carbono*](https://pedazosdecarbono.blogspot.com/) translating the
  transcript into Spanish:
  [*el aye-aye*](https://pedazosdecarbono.blogspot.com/2011/06/loros-el-universo-y-todo-el-aye-aye.html),
  [*Komodo*](https://pedazosdecarbono.blogspot.com/2011/06/loros-el-universo-y-todo-komodo.html),
  [*el kakapo*](https://pedazosdecarbono.blogspot.com/2011/06/loros-el-universo-y-todo-el-kakapo.html),
  [*el baiji*](https://pedazosdecarbono.blogspot.com/2011/06/loros-el-universo-y-todo-el-kakapo.html), and
  [*el humano*](https://pedazosdecarbono.blogspot.com/2011/07/loros-el-universo-y-todo-el-humano.html).

* **May 2011.** Nearly a year after the project started the transcript was all completed
  by anonymous contributors. Although there were no more missing bits in the text, small
  fixes and additional improvements kept arriving throughout the years.

* **July 2010.** Already a month after starting the project the first edits, from
  anonymous contributors over the internet, started coming in.

* **June 2010.** [nokyotsu][] wrote the first basic draft of the transcript in English.
  Although mostly complete, this first version was far from perfect—not being a native
  speaker there were a few places where he couldn't get the precise words from Douglas,
  and some misspellings invariably slipped through.

  As an experiment in ‘openness’ he made the sources of the transcript publicly
  editable, so by-passers could contribute adding the missing pieces and generally
  improving the transcript. The backend, hosted at navarroj.com/parrots, was just a
  bunch of messy perl scripts on top of svn.
